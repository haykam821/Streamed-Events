# Streamed Events

When IO meets functional programming.

## Why?

This package is based off of [`event-stream`](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/). It was created because of [issue #116](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/issues/116); that package is owned by another user who inserted a vulnerable package.

## Docs

See the [`event-stream` docs](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/blob/28e147271c1256f83946415175e5befff739b1de/readme.markdown).
